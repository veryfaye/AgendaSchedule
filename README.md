# AgendaSchedule
Homework assignment to use JavaScript and jQuery to create a day planner.

## Description
This webpage is a calendar app. It allows the user to enter text into each time block, and save it. The information the user saves persists in their time blocks. The time blocks are color coded for ease of understanding as well. If the current time is after the time block then it is colored gray, if the current time is within the time block then it is colored red, and if the current time is before the time block then it is colored green. See images below for screenshots of the app, and [here](https://veryfaye.github.io/AgendaSchedule/) is a link to use the app.
